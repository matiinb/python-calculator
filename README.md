# python-calculator

## About
 A calculator app programmed in Python using the PyQT Library for the UI
 
## Features
 You can perform simple mathematics operations on both positive and negative numbers. You can also copy the result whenever you need it. A hotkey is also set for each button in the UI.
 
## Dependencies
 If you intend to run the python files in order to run the calculator app, you need to have the following dependencies/libraries/packages installed:
  - Python 3.10
  - Python Pyperclip library
  - Python Keyboard library
  - Python PyQT5 library

## How I Created The Executable File (.exe)
 For creating the `.exe` file, I used Python's `PyInstaller` package which is widely used.

## Important Note
 When downloading the exe file from the releases section of the repostiory, probably your antivirus program will say this is a virus or trojan. That is a false positive, because I myself tested the main file with my antivirus app (Bitdefender) and it didn't detect anything but then after downloading it from the repo, it showed me that creepy warning. Something else to also note is that when running the app on Windows, you might get the Windows Defender SmartScreen warning. That is related to package certificates. Don't worry about that too.
